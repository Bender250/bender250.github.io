In last year, I tried to apply to several universities and top companies across Nordic countries and Switzerland. I somehow passed four interviews, and at the beginning of July, I was accepted for PhD at [ETH Zurich by supervision of Professor David Basin at Information Security Group](http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/). The contract started by the 1st of September.

Therefore I enjoyed quite free summer, I [finished as much work as possible by CRoCS FI MUNI](https://github.com/crocs-muni/CryptoStreams/issues), and I prepared a bit for my new job. So right now I live by Tomáš, in [Oerlikon](https://goo.gl/maps/2uff5YziGav), I travel to school every day by bike and work on several projects to determine my PhD topic.

This blog serves as a media to inform those, that were close to me, how is my life in the new city. After experience with [Erasmus blog](https://bender250.github.io/), which is still unfinished (and it won't change :(), I plan to write shorter stories. It was both praised by the readers, and I will manage to write more often. I have already ten posts ideas, including this one, so I have some work to do.

The blog will be in English, so it is available to my Erasmus friends, my schoolmates and people I do not yet know. But you can join the discussion in any language.

Each post should have some image, so here is a picture I took on short hike after my first interview visit.
