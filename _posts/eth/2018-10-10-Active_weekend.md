I wanted to go on a two-day hike from 6-7th October, but it ended up in two separated trips.

# Saturday to Rigi

Rigi is 1798 m high mountain between the biggest lakes in the region. It is visible from Zurich, and due to easy accessibility by train (to the top), it is a favorite destination for families and mainly Asians.

We started from [Seebodenalp above KÃ¼ssnacht at 1020 masl and hiked the way up](https://en.mapy.cz/s/37iCb).

*From the top was visible Zurich, Luzern, mountains above Luzern (Esel - Pilatus, available by cable car) and the gorgeous Alps to the south.*

*There were two nice shelters with grill and chopped wood, free to use. It might be a nice trip to picknick there in the future.*

# Sunday to Chingizpass

I have got a full-suspension mountain bike before departure to Switzerland. I did not have an opportunity to test it in real mountains, until Sunday, October 7th.

I inspired by [this blog post](http://chregu.veloblog.ch/post/94/2257). Unfortunately, I have not motivated anyone to go with me, so I went alone, informing Tom about the schedule, exact track, and dangerous places, so someone knows about me if I get injured. I also had to take quite a lot of stuff, as there was a chance of raining/snowing above 2000 meters.

*Weather was fine - allowing such pictures without getting sunburned.*

I took [the same path](https://en.mapy.cz/s/37iRP) and approach as the referenced blog post. From Schwyz, I took a bus to Muotathal, from where my ascent began. I knew I have to climb from 630 masl to 2080 masl, and I was scared by the hight of the mountains around (=above) me. But just hour and a half later, these scary mountains by Muotathal were below me, and I focused on even higher peaks in the direction of the pass.

*Bike at the beginning of the trip.*

I stopped for a snack at [a freely accessible cabin](https://en.mapy.cz/s/37j2e) that I forget to photograph. But I think I will visit it in winter and sleep there - the surroundings will be great for snow-shoeing or ski-touring.

*Poem about how to behave in the hut :).*

After this cabin, the road changed from asphalt to gravel, and the slope has got steeper. I missed easier gears on the bike. Especially the last 200 elevation meters were worst, and I had to push the bike two times. Snow was only in the shadows and above 2000 m.

*Mountain Fuller. Due to the weather, I took many pictures of it. It was also an excuse to rest a bit.*

Finally, I got to the top after 3.5 hours of ascent. Closer to exhaustion than ever during last year. Hiking is so much easier. But the views were worthy.

*On the top, immediately after reaching it.*

I spend more than half an hour on the top, heating myself on the sun and finally eating my lunch at 14:30. There is another cabin, also freely accessible (I was told there are not such cabins in Switzerland), even more beautiful than the last one.

*Cabin in Chingiz pass. It was even nicer inside, having 2 beds.*

The ascent was challenging my stamina, the descent my riding skills. My approach in many sports *"Who is not falling is climbing/ice-skating/skiing... below its limits"*. was not the smartest there. The path was steep, the gravel was slicker, and then there was a stone across the road. I managed to jump over it, which increased my speed and I was not able to break before the next curve, letting the bike go. I was fortunate to get only a few scratches on hand and knee.

*A trail with such a view - a paradise for most of my biking friends.*

The road became again bigger after a kilometer, technically not so challenging, but appropriate for me to learn how to use the new bike. Once I met a guy on a hard-tail bike, and I have seen, how much more work he has with the terrain. I was more or less sitting due to being tired.

*Autumn colors.*

Final descent of 1200 meters was a test for the brakes, burning most of the time.

*Bike with mountains and Lake Lucerne in the background. Luckily there were such views to stop and cool the brakes a bit.*

Conclusions:
* 36.75 km
* 2300 m of ascent, 2500 descent
* 6 hours
* Lost smart-watch (the band broke a bit after the fall, and they fell off me during the descent)
