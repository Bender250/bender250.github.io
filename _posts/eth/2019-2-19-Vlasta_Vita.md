title: Vlasta and Víťa in Zurich
---

From Feb 16 to 24, Vlasta and Víťa visited Zurich for cybersecurity training SANS. Fortunately, they had also some free time!

On Sunday, we went to Uetliberg, almost 900 m high hill almost in Zurich. It took me just half a year to visit the most prominent hiking area in Zurich.

*View on the Zurichsee and mountains.*

On Wednesday, I was invited for dinner, Víťa wanted to experience [Fondue Chinoise](https://www.bernerhof-zuerich.ch/fondue-chinoise). I horribly underestimated the price (66 CHF per person - whups), but the food and the process of dinning was an enjoyable experience.

On Saturday, we made the same trip as with Vláďa to Luzern and chocolate factory on the way.

*Spring is already here. It is nice in the city, but I still have plans for snowshoeing and ski touring.*
