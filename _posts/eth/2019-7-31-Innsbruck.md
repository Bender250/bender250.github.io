During July 26 to 31, I had a visitors Berta, Jára, Kuba, and Marles. We stayed for three night in Zurich and then we drove to Innsbruck for an additional three nights.

## Pizol five lakes hike

On Friday, we decided on a [hike of five lakes](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/routes/route-0931.html). Eventually, we have seen even more lakes, some hazy views, I had a chance to swim, and due to the time lost swimming, we were almost caught by a T-storm.

*The first lake. It did not seem deep enough for a good swim.*

*The second lake was deeper, worthy for a swim.*

*Colours of the third lake were more as in fairy tail, also colder water.*

*Third lake from above, with several tiny lakes around.*

*The fourth lake.*

As you can see, the lakes are getting prettier as the color turned to turquoise. If you are waiting for the fifth lake, it was not so beautiful, and it would break this gradation, so I did not take a photo of it.

We were glad to do the hike in the more ascending direction (taking a gondola down). It was both better for our knees and views.

## Zurich and Luzern

Zurich and Luzern sightseeing become a must for all visits, with an optional chocolate factory tour on the way.

## Bad Ragaz

Bad Ragaz is a small village close to Pizol, famous for its thermal springs. The spring is located in Tamina gorge.

*Where is the fog coming from? Ah, it is steam, from the spring (36.5 °C)*

In general, I appreciate we did hikes that were new for me. Hopefully, they were also the best given the weather.

## Innsbruck

In Innsbruck, we were staying in a cute Airbnb in a side valley. Our view allowed us to watch the sunset over Innsbruck and reach surrounding mountains easily. Unfortunately, the weather remained quite similar.

*Views from [Hundskopf](https://en.mapy.cz/s/3xzlb). Due to this and the slippery path in quite exposed terrain, we have reached the top only two of us.*

*Is this also a military complex?*

In the afternoon, I fare-well with my friends and hitchhikes to Zurich for another adventure. I needed two rides to get to Switzerland, both were cool people! And I have seen mountain passes on the way to Davos that we skipped due to bad weather.
