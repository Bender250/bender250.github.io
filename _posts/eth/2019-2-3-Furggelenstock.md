title: Ski tour to Furggelenstock with meetup
---

On February 2, I joined meetup ski tour. Planning with the avalanche danger is a matter of having several plans and select the proper one in the day of the trip. So due to avalanche danger 3+, we changed to the easiest option (to my comfort).

*Grosser and Kleiner Mythen were our companions for the whole day.*

We left Zurich at 7:30 at around 9, we were already on skis for the uphill. After 1.5 hours, we reached our highest peak of the trip - Furggelenstock (1656 masl).

*Our international group (2 Polish, Italian, Canadian one Swiss and the remaining one I do not know). And Fish. I should have not asked about professions - mostly informaticians. This is becoming a stereotype. The only lady canceled on Friday.*

*Furggelenstock from the ridge.*

I did not do any downhill skiing in 2018, so going down in the powder on borrowed skis was scary for the first moments.

*Such skiing looks natural.*

Fortunately, the group had patience with me, my stability progressed, I got used to the powder more, and my fear was suppressed a bit.

*Steepest part of the tour.*

I fell just once - 50 meters from the end of the slope, practicing carving in the powder - worth it!

We also trained avalanche rescue, so I got some hands-on to the theory I watched on youtube.
