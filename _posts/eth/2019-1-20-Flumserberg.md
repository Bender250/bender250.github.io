title: Cross-country in Flumserberg
---

Last Sunday (January 20) I went with Honza cross-country skiing in Flumserberg area.

Honza is a PhD student of physics, who also started last summer, so we met at PhD welcoming event. He wanted to go cross-country skiing but knew only classic style. I was interested, but I wanted to go to real mountains (cross country tracks are usually in valleys here). So is the Flumserberg area, the plan had just a single pitfall, the trail there is only for skating style with an ascent of 500 m.

Anyway, we decided to try it. Note to self: do not borrow skis in Swiss mountains, the price for skating skis, shoes and poles was 42 CHF.

I was a great teacher of skating technique. I fell just after 2 meters after putting the skis on!

*The purpose of taking this picture was taking a break, as I was exhausted from skating.*

*The views were worthy!*

*Views from the highest point of our trail, other mountains still significantly above us.*

Surprisingly, we managed the way back without troubles, although part of it was a red piste. It was definitely fun!

PS: I have a new camera, so you can expect better pictures. Maybe it is not obious in this post, as the weather was not too photo-friendly. Also the compression for web is quite significant.
