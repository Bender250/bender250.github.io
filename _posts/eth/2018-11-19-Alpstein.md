title: Alpstein with Tobi, Steffen, and Angelica

Finally a multi-day hike. The weather in fall is fantastic, northern mountains are still snow-free even above 2000 masl. So we used the opportunity to go to an extremely touristy area - Alpstein.

*This is my first vegan cake (soy flour and soy milk instead of eggs and milk). And surprisingly it tasted the same as with eggs and milk.*

We have got, what we expected - sunny weather, few other hikers, steep ascent *"Where is the trail going - how can we get over that rock?"* But everything in a very civilized countryside - tracks and huts everywhere.

*We were afraid about the duration of ascent. So we set a fast pace and actually hiked almost entire Saturday part before the lunch. We left the lowlands in a morning inversion.*

*Our group (missing Tobi and crows shitting on us) and Säntis - highest mountain of Alpstein.*

*With such view: mountains, mountains everywhere.*

So we had a lot of time to take funny unpublishable pictures in the scenery of quite Alps. Until a couple came and made a tent just next to us.

It was slightly freezing during the night but without strong wind. Anyway, I was glad to take my both sleeping bags.
