# Karel living abroad

Welcome to a blog I am using to reach my friends (not only) in Czech Republic.

## Contact

If you wish to visit me in Zurich, you are welcome, just write me at least 2 months in advance, I have quite a busy schedule. For an overview of potential activities, please see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ylIv-RWxMr7prdcibgrKmoxMGiaHf2ny1kIoakegIs/edit?usp=sharing) (sorry for Czech).

I love postcards, if you want to make me happy, please send one. I can send you back some from my trips.
